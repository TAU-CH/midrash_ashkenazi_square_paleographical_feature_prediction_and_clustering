# midrash_ashkenazi_square_paleographical_feature_prediction_and_clustering
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to predict the paleographical attributes for each manuscript page. Following this, a brute-force search is performed to find the feature combinations that lead to the most cohesive clusters.

The trained model is [here](https://github.com/TAU-CH/midrash_ashkenazi_square_paleographical_feature_prediction_and_clustering/releases/download/v1.0.0/best_model_11.pth).
